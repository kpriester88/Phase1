# Lab Report: Phase 1-W1D1 — Terminal Velocity

**Subject:** Headless Linux Navigation & Filesystem Mastery  
**Status:** Completed ✅

---

## 📝 Executive Summary
This lab focused on transitioning from a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** environment. The primary goal was to navigate the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) using "mental sonar" (commands) rather than visual icons.

## 🏢 The Mental Model: The Office Building
During this lab, the Linux filesystem was treated as a structured office building to ensure logical navigation:

* **The Root (`/`)**: The Lobby. The starting point for all paths.
* **The Tool Shed (`/bin`)**: Where the essential binaries (executable commands) are kept.
* **The Manager’s Office (`/etc`)**: Where system-wide configuration files are stored.
* **The Employee Desks (`/home`)**: My personal workspace and user directory.

## ⌨️ Command Syntax & Grammar
I reinforced the fundamental grammar of the Linux terminal to avoid syntax errors:  
**Command → Flag(s) → Argument**

| Command | Purpose | Common Flags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `pwd` | **Print Working Directory**: "Where am I in the building?" | N/A |
| `ls` | **List**: "Turn on the lights." | `-a` (hidden), `-l` (long format) |
| `cd` | **Change Directory**: "Move to another room." | `..` (up), `/` (lobby) |
| `cat` | **Concatenate**: "Read the contents of a file." | N/A |

## 🧠 Key Concepts Mastered

### Absolute vs. Relative Paths
* **Absolute Paths**: Navigating by starting from the Lobby (`/`). 
  * *Example:* `/home/student/evidence`
* **Relative Paths**: Navigating based on my current "desk."
  * *Example:* `cd ../reports`

### The "Hidden" Room
I learned that files starting with a `.` are hidden from standard view. To "see through the walls," I must use the specific flag (`-a`) that reveals all contents.

## 🔦 Reflections from the Dark Room
* **Hardest Part:** Resisting the urge to use the VS Code file explorer.
* **Breakthrough:** Realizing that the terminal output is the only truth. If the terminal says a file doesn't exist, I am either in the wrong room or using the wrong path.
